### Build

Sprites live in onboard memory and thus need to be precompiled before flashing
onto the pico. To convert .bmp files in the sprites directory run:

```bash
./convert_sprites.sh
```

Run the following command:

> [!NOTE]\
> PICO_SDK_PATH should be set in your .bashrc to the `pico-sdk` folder in this
> directory.

```bash
rm -rf build && mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DPICO_SDK_PATH=$PICO_SDK_PATH
make -j4
cd ..
```

or just run the build script (just has the above commands):

```bash
./build.sh
```
